  [ Dima Kogan ] 
  * New package (Closes: #729457)
  * New upstream release using Dima Kogan's enhanced tree (Closes:
    #653662, #672194). Main changes from the stable code in the cscope
    CVS:
    - New searches are appended to the *cscope* buffer, instead of
      overwriting.
    - The *cscope* buffer can be navigated and edited similarly to emacs Diff
      buffers
    - Previous searches can be re-run with the 'r' key in the *cscope* buffer.
    - xcscope.el can now work remotely over TRAMP
    - The indexing output now goes to the echo area instead of an explicit new
      buffer that the user must deal with
    - Better mouse support
    - Removed the external 'cscope-indexer' script
    - Various cscope options can now be accessed through the emacs variables
