xcscope-el (1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release using Dima Kogan's enhanced tree. Main changes
    from the stable code in the cscope CVS:

    - New searches are appended to the *cscope* buffer, instead of
      overwriting.
  
    - The *cscope* buffer can be navigated and edited similarly to emacs Diff
      buffers

    - Previous searches can be re-run with the 'r' key in the *cscope* buffer.

    - xcscope.el can now work remotely over TRAMP

    - The indexing output now goes to the echo area instead of an explicit new
      buffer that the user must deal with

    - Better mouse support

    - Removed the external 'cscope-indexer' script

    - Various cscope options can now be accessed through the emacs variables
