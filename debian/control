Description: Interactively examine a C program source in emacs
 Cscope is a program that generates index tables from C and C++ source
 files. It is also a client program that knows how to use the
 generated index tables to answer questions such as where is a symbol
 defined, where is a symbol referenced, etc.
 .
 xcscope-el contains the Emacs interfaces to cscope
